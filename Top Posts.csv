0,Help! My CA says my ₹21k trading profit is actually ₹1 Lakh for tax. How is this possible?,"Hey fellow traders, I'm really confused about my taxes and hope someone can shed some light.

* My PnL for last year shows a total profit of **21K**
* I gave this to my CA for ITR filing, and he told me my taxable profit is **1 Lakh.** .
* He says my profits are taxable, but my losses are mostly ""intraday"" and can only be carried forward. They can't be used to reduce my current profit.



**My Trading Style:** I primarily do swing trading with a GTT stop-loss. Sometimes, a trade I intend to hold for several days hits the stop-loss and gets exited on the same day. I believe this is why they are being classified as intraday trades.

Is a trade intended for swing but closed on the same day automatically considered an ""Intraday/Speculative"" trade for tax purposes?

Is it true that these ""intraday"" losses cannot be set off against my swing trading (STCG) profits?

Do I really have to pay tax on ₹1 Lakh even though my net PnL was only ₹21k? Is there any way to correctly offset these losses to reduce my tax liability?

3,End of Weekly Expiry = End of Retail Traders? SEBI Thinks So.,"Just saw this 

 SEBI and the Finance Ministry are apparently in talks to reduce speculation in the options market. Some major stuff on the table:

Ending weekly option expiry, shifting to bi-monthly or monthly

Cutting margin requirements in the cash market

Possibly lowering STT on cash market trades


Govt feels weekly expiries are being misused for pure speculation, not actual hedging.

If this happens, it could seriously impact retail traders who rely on weekly moves. Could also push more volume back into the cash market.

What do you guys think  is this a good move to bring balance or is it just going to kill retail participation?",1mis2lj,59,17,https://i.redd.it/2txweue72bhf1.jpeg

7,"Trump has lost his mind, another 25% tariff, now total 50%","Seriously, what’s this clown playing at? Doubling tariffs on India just because they’re buying Russian oil like it’s some personal vendetta. Meanwhile, China and Pakistan get off easy.

We Indians are just trying to survive in a messy world, and Trump’s busy being the biggest headache. He used to call India a friend, but now? Friends, my a\*\*. He’s just messing up ties and screwing regular people on both sides.  
  
Honestly, who even benefits from this? Not India. Not the US. Just Trump’s ego trip.",1mj6yca,36,42,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/1mj6yca/trump_has_lost_his_mind_another_25_tariff_now/

9,No way US' tariffs of 50% on India could last beyond 2028; No need to Panic,"Trump just recently announced 25% penalty on India over and above the prior 25% tariff announced, due to its purchase of Russian oil.  
Trump is in no way going to get a third term and new President would definitely understand the importance of the crucial US-India relationship and would not want to lose a key ally. 
There is negligible chance that the tariffs would remain above 20% beyond 2028, if not sooner.  
US only accounts for less than 20% of India's Exports and Exports themselves (incl services with Zero tariff) are 20%-25% of GDP so no need to panic on the news. Also, Our pharma dominance in APIs is still excluded from tariffs.",1mj6hmn,28,28,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/1mj6hmn/no_way_us_tariffs_of_50_on_india_could_last/
